(require 'package)

;; Add MELPA (Milkypostman's Emacs Lisp Package Archive) to the list of package archives.
;; This allows you to install packages from this widely-used repository, similar to how
;; pip works for Python or npm for Node.js. While Emacs comes with ELPA (Emacs Lisp
;; Package Archive) configured by default, which contains packages that meet specific
;; licensing criteria, MELPA offers a broader range of packages and is considered the
;; standard for Emacs users. You can also add more package archives later as needed.

;; Nerd Fonts symbols throughout the configuration. This boolean variable allows

;; From now on, you'll see configurations using the `use-package` macro, which
;; allows us to organize our Emacs setup in a modular way. These configurations
;; look like this:
;;
;; (use-package some-package
;;   :ensure t     ;; Ensure the package is installed (used with package.el).
;;   :straight t   ;; Use straight.el to install and manage this package.
;;   :config       ;; Configuration settings for the package.
;;   ;; Additional settings can go here.
;; )
;;
;; This approach simplifies package management, enabling us to easily control
;; both built-in (first-party) and external (third-party) packages. While Emacs
;; is a vast and powerful editor, using `use-package`—especially in combination
;; with `straight.el`—helps streamline our configuration for better organization,
;; reproducibility, and customization. As we proceed, you'll see smaller
;; `use-package` declarations for specific packages, which will help us enable
;; the desired features and improve our workflow.

;;; LSP
;; Emacs comes with an integrated LSP client called `eglot', which offers basic LSP functionality.
;; However, `eglot' has limitations, such as not supporting multiple language servers
;; simultaneously within the same buffer (e.g., handling both TypeScript, Tailwind and ESLint
;; LSPs together in a React project). For this reason, the more mature and capable
;; `lsp-mode' is included as a third-party package, providing advanced IDE-like features
;; and better support for multiple language servers and configurations.
;;
;; NOTE: To install or reinstall an LSP server, use `M-x install-server RET`.
;;       As with other editors, LSP configurations can become complex. You may need to
;;       install or reinstall the server for your project due to version management quirks
;;       (e.g., asdf or nvm) or other issues.
;;       Fortunately, `lsp-mode` has a great resource site:

;;
;; In the Neovim ecosystem, similar functionality is provided by plugins such as

;; allow you to perform Git operations directly within Neovim. Another popular
;; option is `neogit', which provides a more modern and user-friendly interface
