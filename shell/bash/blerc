## Basic settings


## The following setting specifies the input encoding. Currently only "UTF-8"
## and "C" is available.

bleopt input_encoding=UTF-8


## The following setting specifies the pager used by ble.sh.  This is used to
## show the help of commands (f1).

bleopt pager=less

## The following setting specifies the editor used by ble.sh.  This is used for
## the widget edit-and-execute (C-x C-e) and editor for a large amount of
## command line texts.  Possible values include, for example, "vim", "emacs
## -nw" and "nano".

bleopt editor=vim


## The following settings sets the behavior of visible bells (vbell).  The
## option "vbell_duration" sets the time duration to show the vbell.  The
## option "vbell_align" controls the position of vbell with a colon-separated
## fields. The fields "left", "center", and "right" specify that the vbell
## should be shown up on the left, center, and right, respectively, in the
## terminal display.  The default is "right".  The field "panel" specify that
## vbell should be shown below the command line within the line editor
## interface (as far as the line editor is currently active).  The faces
## "vbell", "vbell_erase", and "vbell_flash" specify the graphic style of the
## vbell, the one after vbell is erased, and the one used to blink the vbell,
## respectively.

#bleopt vbell_default_message=' Wuff, -- Wuff!! '
#bleopt vbell_duration=2000
#bleopt vbell_align=right
#ble-face vbell='reverse'
#ble-face vbell_erase='bg=252'
#ble-face vbell_flash='fg=green,reverse'


##-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Line editor settings


## This option controls the behavior of the bell in the line editing by
## colon-separated values.  When "abell", "vbell", and "visual" are contained,
## the audible bells, the visible bells, and the visual bells are enabled.  The
## audible bell sends BEL to the terminal.  The visible bell shows the message
## on the terminal display.  The visual bell is the GNU-Screen style bell that
## flashes the terminal display by turning on DECSCNM in a short moment.  Old
## settings "edit_vbell" and "edit_abell" should be updated to use "edit_bell".

#bleopt edit_bell=abell


## The following setting turns on the delayed load of history when an non-empty
## value is set.

#bleopt history_lazyload=1


## The following setting turns on the delete selection mode when an non-empty
## value is set. When the mode is turned on the selection is removed when a
## user inserts a character.

#bleopt delete_selection_mode=1


## The following settings control the indentation. "indent_offset" sets the
## indent width. "indent_tabs" controls if tabs can be used for indentation or
## not. If "indent_tabs" is set to 0, tabs will never be used. Otherwise
## indentation is made with tabs and spaces.

#bleopt indent_offset=4
#bleopt indent_tabs=1


## "undo_point" controls the cursor position after "undo".  When "beg" and
## "end" are specified, the cursor will be moved to the beginning and the end,
## respectively, of the dirty section.  When "first" and "last" are specified,
## the cursor position will be the first and last positions, respectively, for
## which the resulting line content is recorded.  When "near" is specified, it
## behaves like "last" for undo and "first" for redo.  Otherwise, it behaves
## like "beg" for vi command modes and "near" for the other modes.  The default
## is "auto".

#bleopt undo_point=near


## The following setting controls forced layout calculations before graphical
## operations. When a non-empty value is specified, the forced calculations are
## enabled. When an empty string is set, the operations are switched to logical
## ones.

#bleopt edit_forced_textmap=1


## The following option controls the interpretation of lines when going to the
## beginning or the end of the current line.  When the value `logical` is
## specified, the logical line is used, i.e., the beginning and the end of the
## line is determined based on the newline characters in the edited text.  When
## the value `graphical` is specified, the graphical line is used, i.e., the
## beginning and the end of the displayed line in the terminal is used.

#bleopt edit_line_type=graphical


## The following option specifies the set of expansions performed by
## magic-space with a colon-separated list of expansion types. "history",
## "sabbrev", "alias", and "autocd" can be specified.

#bleopt edit_magic_expand=history:sabbrev


## This option configures the detailed behavior of the widget "magic-space"
## with a colon-separated list.  If the field "inline-sabbrev-no-insert" is
## specified, the insertion of "SP" is skipped when the inline sabbrev is
## performed by "magic-space".

#bleopt edit_magic_opts=


## This option specifies the expansions performed on accept-line by a
## colon-separated list.  The expansion is performed in a similar way as Bash's
## history expansion.  When "sabbrev", "alias", "autocd", and "history" is
## specified, the respective expansions are attempted on the command line.
## When "verify" is specified, if sabbrev, alias, or autocd expansions changed
## the command line, the execution of the command line is canceled so the user
## can examine or continue to edit the expanded line.  The history expansion
## can be controlled by "shopt -s histverify" in a similar manner.  When
## "verify-syntax" is specified and any expansions change the command string, a
## syntax check is performed.  The command execution is canceled when the
## command string is not syntactically complete.  When "history-line" is
## specified, the history expansion replaces the command line instead of just
## printing the expansion result.  The default value of this option is empty.

#bleopt edit_magic_accept=sabbrev
